Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13102" target="_blank">Particle Guidance: non-I.I.D. Diverse Sampling with Diffusion Models</a> by Gabriele Corso, Yilun Xu, Valentin de Bortoli, Regina Barzilay and Tommi Jaakkola in Stable Diffusion XL.

To try the implementation, open SD_XL/Demo_Particle_Guidance.ipynb. Please note, that at least 40 GB GRAM are needed. To visit the implemented pipeline, open SD_XL/diffusers/pipelines/stable_diffusion_xl/pipeline_stable_diffusion_xl_diffusion_particle.py

Furthermore a new technique called reference guidance is implemented.
